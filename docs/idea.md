Perfect. That is an outstanding plan. Focusing on both resilience **and** operational excellence is exactly what distinguishes a good project from a great one. Starting with RabbitMQ builds the strong foundation first, which is the right priority.

You now have all the components for a truly top-tier CV project. Let's put it all together into a final project brief.

### Project Title: **TraceCraft**

**The Elevator Pitch:** A lightweight distributed tracing system built with a microservices architecture, featuring a resilient data pipeline using RabbitMQ and an AI-powered co-pilot for automated root cause analysis.

**Core Concepts You'll Demonstrate:**

- **Distributed Systems:** Microservice design, inter-service communication, context propagation.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Building a resilient data pipeline with a message queue (RabbitMQ).
- **Full-Stack Development:** Java/Spring Boot backend, Angular frontend.
- **Applied AI:** Using a local LLM (Ollama) as a practical diagnostic tool with sophisticated prompt engineering.
- **DevOps & Cloud-Native:** Containerization (Docker) and orchestration (`docker-compose`).
- **Software Design:** Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for the Java instrumentation library.

### Final Architecture

Here is the system you're going to build:

```
[ Instrumented         [ Instrumented
  Service 1 (Java) ]     Service 2 (Java) ]
       |                      |
       | (Trace Spans)        | (Trace Spans)

### Your Development Roadmap

This is a step-by-step plan to build **TraceCraft**:

1.  **Milestone 1: The Core Tracing Logic (The "Magic Annotation").**

    - Create a simple Spring Boot starter (`instrumentation-lib`).
    - Use AOP to create the `@Traceable` annotation. For now, just make it log the trace/span IDs and method execution time to the console.
    - Create two simple "business" Spring Boot apps (e.g., `user-service` and `order-service`) that call each other. Add your library and annotation to prove that context propagation works.

2.  **Milestone 2: The Resilient Data Pipeline (The RabbitMQ Focus).**

    - Set up a RabbitMQ instance (Docker is perfect for this).
    - Modify your `instrumentation-lib` to publish trace span data to a RabbitMQ queue instead of logging it.
    - Build the `collector-service`. Its only job is to consume messages from RabbitMQ and save them to a PostgreSQL database.

3.  **Milestone 3: The Visualization Layer.**

    - Build the `query-api` service. It will expose a REST endpoint like `GET /traces/{traceId}` that fetches all spans for a trace from the database.
    - Build the `angular-frontend`. Create a simple UI where you can paste a `traceId` and see a waterfall/Gantt chart view of the spans fetched from the API.

4.  **Milestone 4: The AI Diagnostician.**

    - Build the `ai-service` in Python.
    - Create a `POST /diagnose` endpoint.
    - Inside, fetch trace data using the `query-api`, format it into a clear text prompt, and send it to your local Ollama instance.
    - Add a "Diagnose this Trace" button to your Angular UI that calls this new service and displays the AI's analysis.

5.  **Milestone 5: Operational Excellence (The Production-Ready Polish).**
    - Write a `Dockerfile` for every single one of your microservices (Collector, Query API, AI Service, Frontend).
    - Create a master `docker-compose.yml` file that defines and links all your services, including the PostgreSQL database and RabbitMQ.
    - Now you can start the _entire_ distributed system with a single command: `docker-compose up`. This is hugely impressive.

This project is a perfect intersection of your skills and ambitions. It's not just another CRUD app; it's a piece of core infrastructure. When you talk about this in an interview, you won't just be showing codeâ€”you'll be discussing architectural trade-offs (e.g., "Why RabbitMQ over a simple HTTP call?"), design patterns, and how to build robust, observable systems.

You are ready to start. Good luck, and have fun building
